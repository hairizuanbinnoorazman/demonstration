# Quickstart Kubernetes

This repository contains sample applications that is used to demonstrate and try out Kubernetes capability for the uninitiated.

Slides that was used to present this is also provided here as well.
NOTE: Do not copy commands wholesale from pdfs. The pdf is generated from Google Drive and often copy and pasting code snippets from here causes issues. 

# Improvements

Some of the following things will be done to ease the readability
- A complete readme that would details instructions on how to run thru the demonstrations (As of now, commands are only within the pdf slides)
- Convert slides to use text based slide generation tools (Allow proper versioning of slides)
